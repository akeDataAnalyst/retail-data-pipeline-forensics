Project 1: The "Event-Driven" Stock Intelligence System
Focus: Stock performance, independent discrepancy identification, and forecasting.

1. Problem Statement
The business suffers from "Silent Stock-outs" during major Dubai events (e.g., Dubai Shopping Festival, Ramadan, or Black Friday). The existing data in Google Sheets is "dirty"—containing duplicated transaction IDs, impossible stock levels (negative values), and inconsistent date formats.

2. Solution (The Tech Stack)
Data Generation (Python Faker): Generate a dataset with 50,000+ rows including product_id, stock_on_hand, sales_velocity, event_name, and location. Intentionally inject errors: 5% duplicate IDs, 2% negative stock, and "NULL" values for category names.

Data Cleaning (Python): Write a script using pandas to "independently identify irregularities." Document how you handled them (e.g., using df.drop_duplicates() and imputing missing categories based on product_id).

Database (MySQL): Load the cleaned data into MySQL. Write complex queries to calculate Stock Turnover Ratio during "Event" vs. "Non-Event" periods.

Stakeholder Delivery (Google Sheets/App Script): Use the gspread library in Python to push a "Low Stock Alert" report directly to a Google Sheet.

3. Key Portfolio Feature
Include a "Data Integrity Log" in your project README. List exactly how many "errors" your Python script found and fixed. This speaks directly to the JD’s requirement for a "keen eye for detail."

Project 2: Buyer Persona & Competitor Partnership Impact Study
Focus: Demographics, competitor benchmarking, and actionable insights.

1. Problem Statement
The marketing team doesn't know which "Partner Campaigns" (e.g., a collab with a local Dubai influencer or a bank partnership) are actually driving high-value customers versus one-time "bargain hunters." They also need to see how competitors are capturing specific gender and age demographics.

2. Solution (The Tech Stack)
Data Generation (Python Faker): Generate buyer data including gender, age_group, nationality_segment (to reflect Dubai's expat diversity), and partnership_source.

Analysis (Python): Perform RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) to segment buyers.

Example Persona: "The Luxury Tourist" (High Monetary, Low Frequency) vs. "The Resident Saver" (Low Monetary, High Frequency).

MySQL Implementation: Join the Buyer table with a "Competitor Benchmarking" table (simulated data of competitor price points and active partnerships).

Visualization: Create a dashboard that compares Your Brand vs. Competitor performance by demographic.

3. Key Portfolio Feature
Create a "Strategic Recommendations" slide at the end of the project. For example: "Data shows our partnership with 'Bank A' attracts 40% more Female shoppers aged 25-34. Recommend extending this partnership during the Ramadan sale period."
